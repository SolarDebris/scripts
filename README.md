# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I have created and used for various things

# Ideas
Some ideas that I have to make into shell scripts are:
  - Getting and building big projects for vulnerability research (chromium, kernel, etc)
  - Environment Setup (CTF stuff, emulating stuff)
  - Fuzzing stuff
  - Creating build scripts for certain projects
  - Automation of linux and macos environments and stuff
