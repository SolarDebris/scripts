# Scripts
A collection of scripts, templates, and other small projects that i use.

# Ideas
Some ideas that I have to make into shell scripts are:
  - Getting and building big projects for vulnerability research (chromium, kernel, etc)
  - Environment Setup (CTF stuff, emulating stuff)
  - Fuzzing stuff
  - Creating build scripts for certain projects
  - Automation of linux and macos environments and stuff
